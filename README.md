# Chicago-Crimes
Assignment for Northwestern University Database Course: exploring Chicago Crimes data for insights

In this project, I create a cloropleth map of Chicago's districts, shaded by crime frequency. 

I impose Marker Clusters on the choropleth map for gun-related crimes that have Location Description as RESIDENCE in (green icon) and those that have Location Description as STREET in (red icon), to create an interactive map exploring geographical patterns of gun crimes committed in Chicago.

Using SQL I create a cross tabulation of the proportion of arrests made for each crime type.
